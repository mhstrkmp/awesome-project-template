# ðŸ˜Ž Awesome Project Template ðŸ˜Ž

## Getting Started

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run start`

To start the server.

#### `npm run server`

To start the server with Nodemon. That's especcialy useful if you are developing the server file. Nodemon handles restarting the server on change for you.

#### `npm run client`

To start the create-react-app.

#### `npm run storybook`

To start storybook.

#### `npm run dev`

To start server and client with concurrently.

#### `npm run test`

To run your tests.

#### `npm run build`

To build create-react-app and storybook. Normally you wouldn't do this, as your deployment pipeline will take care of this.

### Deployment

Configuration is optimized for deployment with Heroku. If you want to deploy this somewhere else you maybe have to change the configuration files.
